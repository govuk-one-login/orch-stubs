# Performance and scaling stubs
These stubs are owned by Orchestration for performance and scaling testing purposes.

There will be three stubs - one for Authentication, one for IPV, and one for SPOT. This will allow Orchestration to exercise different journeys, write Orchestration specific acceptance tests, execute Orchestration performance tests, and test IPV in lower environments.
